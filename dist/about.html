     <p>Hi, my name is John Kyker! I studied with NWU graduating 
        with a BA degree in History-Social Science Education. 
        After working with LPS I decided to go back to school for Computer Science.
        My primary focus is on UI/UX design and front-end development. 
        I'm also passionate about strategy games and I still love to go hiking or fishing.
        Read my resume for further details. <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!Am6a8Kq8JpKRhMB1C-tlxp-20J0rgw?e=dYRvLh">Link</a>
